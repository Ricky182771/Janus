# Janus Python Dependencies
#
# The interactive orchestrator (orchestrator/janus_tui.py) currently uses only
# Python standard library modules (curses, argparse, subprocess, pathlib, etc.).
#
# This file exists as a placeholder so tooling and contributors know the
# dependency surface is intentionally zero.  Add third-party packages here
# if any are introduced in the future.
